summary: Men and women have diverse gender-related needs across social classes, ethnicities, and ages, often neglected by mainstream parties and addressed by radical/populist groups conflicting with EU values. The EU-funded UNTWIST project investigates gender-related concerns in six European political systems, and provides evidence-based policy recommendations to untwist gender-based needs.
