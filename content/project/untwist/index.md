summary: Men and women have different needs, demands and fears related to their gender, which are diverse across social classes, ethnicities and ages. All these needs, demands and worries deserve to be adequately addressed by political representatives in our European democracies. However, many are disregarded by mainstream parties, while the radical/populist political actors currently addressing them go against the EU’s core values. The EU-funded UNTWIST project aims to find ways to unravel how particular needs, demands and worries related to gender can be addressed within the realm of the EU’s core values. Its primary working strategy will consist of empowering (non-radical/populist) parties to improve their representation of the gender-based interests of the citizenry through the definition, enhancement and dissemination of a policy recommendation handbook with evidence-based policy recommendations.
